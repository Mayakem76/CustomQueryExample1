Example of  - Spring Boot - Custom Queries
has an entity Flight with the following columns:
a primary key
a string description
a string fromAirport
a string toAirport
an enum status with (ONTIME, DELAYED and CANCELLED) values
has a dedicated repository with custom methods
has a FlightController mapped on flights;
has a FlightService with all the methods for controller;
- for the provisioning of n flights (where n is an optional query param; if absent, n=100):
  all the string values are randomly generated (using random.ints())
  the status is generated randomly
- for retrieving all the flights in the db using pagination and returning them in ascending order by Departures
- for retrieving all the flights that are ONTIME without using a custom query
- for retrieving - using a custom query - all the flights that are in Status p1 or in Status p2
  consider that the user has to pass p1 and p2 as parameters to the GET request
tested  endpoints with Postman:
for provisioning without the n query parameter
for provisioning with the n query parameter, with value 49
for getting the flights using pagination
for getting the flights that are ONTIME
for getting the delayed or cancelled flights
for getting the on time or delayed flights
